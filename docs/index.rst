ROCm-LS documentation
**********************

The ROCm Life Science (ROCm-LS) toolkit is a collection of open-source software for high-performance life science applications built on the core ROCm platform. ROCm-LS helps you accelerate life science processing and analyze workloads on AMD accelerators and GPUs.

You can leverage ROCm-LS to accelerate both new and existing life science workloads, which helps you execute intensive applications with larger datasets relatively fast. ROCm-LS creates scalable solutions to address the needs of todayâ€™s data-driven landscape. With ROCm-LS, you can build pre- and post-processing applications for your AI models and accelerate your existing life science pipelines with minimal effort.

The ROCm-LS libraries provide tools to build a complete workflow for life science acceleration on AMD GPUs.

.. note::

    ROCm-LS is in an early access state. Running production workloads is not recommended.
