The AMD ROCm™ Life Science toolkit (ROCm-LS) is an open-source, GPU-accelerated library suite for life science and healthcare applications built on the core ROCm platform and optimized for use on AMD GPUs. 

AMD Life Science can be used to accelerate new and existing life science workloads on AMD devices. The suite targets compute-intensive applications that process larger datasets so that you can build pre-processing and post-processing applications for AI models and accelerate existing life science pipelines.

The AMD Life Science libraries provide the following tools for life science acceleration on AMD GPUs:

- **hipCIM**: A GPU imaging library that accelerates and scales image processing on AMD Instinct™ GPUs.
- **MONAI on ROCm**: An open-source framework that brings deep learning for medical imaging to AMD GPU platforms.
- **MONAI Model Zoo**: A collection of MONAI Bundle models with AMD ROCm inference overlays for validated segmentation workloads on AMD Instinct™ GPUs.
- **MONAILabel**: An interactive medical image labeling framework with Early Access AMD GPU support on ROCm.

These tools are integrated into a comprehensive workflow for scientific imaging pipelines that accelerates image I/O and transformation operations for supported whole slide images on AMD GPUs.
