# ROCm-LS 26.08 release notes

The release notes provide a summary of notable changes since the previous ROCm-LS release.

## Release highlights

The following are notable new features and improvements in ROCm-LS 26.08 since the 26.03 release. For detailed changes to individual components, see [detailed component changelogs](#detailed-component-changelogs).

### hipCIM (26.06.00)

- **OME-TIFF and multi-page TIFF support:** Multi-IFD TIFFs are now accepted as a flat page list. Previously, any TIFF with more than one full-resolution IFD raised a parse error. 

- **NIfTI-1 reader:** CuImage now opens `.nii` and `.nii.gz` volumetric files directly, without requiring nibabel or DCMTK. The reader handles endianness detection, gzip decompression using libdeflate, and all common NIfTI-1 data types.

- **DICOM Phase 1 reader:** Single-frame DICOM files, using uncompressed Explicit or Implicit VR Little-Endian, are now readable via CuImage, with no DCMTK or GDCM dependency. Compressed transfer syntaxes, including JPEG Baseline and JPEG 2000, are supported when the library is built with `CUMED_DICOM_COMPRESSED=ON`.

- **rocJPEG handle pool:** rocJPEG decode handles are now pooled at the process level. Previously, a new handle was created and destroyed for every `read_region()` call.

- **Process-level GPU tile cache:** Decoded tiles are cached in GPU memory across `read_region()` calls.

- **Graceful plugin degradation:** A plugin that fails to load, for example when rocJPEG runtime libraries are absent, now logs a warning and is skipped, rather than taking down all formats. NIfTI and DICOM reads succeed even on hosts where slide-format GPU libraries aren't installed.

### MONAI on ROCm (1.6.0)

- **SwinUNETR WindowAttention SDPA:** Scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) via `torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention` is now auto-enabled for SwinUNETR WindowAttention layers on ROCm, replacing the explicit Q×KT×V loop. This accelerates SwinUNETR-based inference on AMD CDNA GPUs.

- **SlidingWindowInferer dynamic graph stabilization:** The sliding window inferer patches an HIP-specific divergence in `torch.compile` graph recompilation caused by non-constant window shapes during inference. This eliminates recompilation storms on variable-resolution inputs.

- **DynUNet GEMM-based ConvTranspose3d:** 3D transposed convolutions in DynUNet are routed through a GEMM-based implementation on ROCm, bypassing a performance regression in the default convolution transpose kernel on CDNA architectures.

### MONAI Model Zoo (26.08)

- **AMD ROCm inference overlays (Early Access):** Five bundles are inference-validated and optimized for AMD Instinct™ GPUs using MONAI Bundle overlay configurations (`inference_rocm.json` or `inference_rocm.yaml`):

  - `vista3d`: VISTA-3D multi-organ segmentation for 130+ structures.
  - `swin_unetr_btcv_segmentation`: Swin UNETR 13-organ abdominal CT segmentation.
  - `wholeBody_ct_segmentation`: SegResNet 104-structure whole-body CT segmentation
  - `spleen_deepedit_annotation`: DeepEdit interactive spleen segmentation.
  - `pancreas_ct_dints_segmentation`: DiNTS pancreas and tumor segmentation.

  All overlays apply channels-last 3D memory format, BF16 AMP, `torch.compile`, and device-aware checkpoint loading without modifying model weights.

### MONAILabel (0.8.5)

- **AMD GPU support (Early Access):** MONAILabel now reports AMD GPU memory and device information on ROCm through three targeted code changes: ROCm-aware `gpu_memory_map()` in `monailabel/utils/others/generic.py`, the `/gpu` REST endpoint in `monailabel/endpoints/logs.py`, and an updated Dockerfile for ROCm runtime. The MONAILabel framework API and all existing apps and plugins are unmodified.

## Detailed component changelogs

The following are changes specific to the ROCm-LS components.

### hipCIM (26.06.00)

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a SIGSEGV in the rocJPEG batch path triggered by scattered or out-of-range `read_region` calls.

- Fixed an OOM abort caused by an unchecked rocJPEG batch device allocation when VRAM was nearly full.

- Fixed a JP2K GPU abort where JPEG 2000-compressed tiles were incorrectly routed to the GPU decode path. JP2K tiles now decode into host memory before transfer.

- Fixed incorrect colour output on RGB-native images (blue/red channel swap) when using the host-input GPU decode path.

- Fixed an undefined-behavior crash where any rocJPEG or HIP error would call `exit(1)`, terminating the host process. Errors now throw `std::runtime_error` so callers can recover.

### MONAI Model Zoo

#### Known issues

- `spleen_deepedit_annotation`: the ROCm overlay calls `network_def.enable_gemm_transpose(True)` when the method is present and sets `evaluator.compile = True`, so `torch.compile` is applied consistently. No source patch is required — the behaviour is configured entirely through the bundle overlay.

### MONAILabel (0.8.5)

#### Known issues

- Pathology app workflows are not validated in this release.
